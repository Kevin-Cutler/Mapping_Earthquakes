# Mapping_Earthquakes

_______________________________
## Overview of Project:
____________________________________________

Working as a data visualization specialist for the Disaster Reporting Network a non profit that provides resources on earthquakes around the world. Our job for this task is to create interactive earthquake maps that are informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones. This new endeavour will increase noteriety and attract positive interest in our Disaster Reporting Company. In this project we will access GeoJSON data from the US geological survey website. We will traverse the earthquake data using Javascript skills and our knowledge of the D3 library. Our goal is to develop a interactive world map to access and plot the data on a mapbox map through a API request. We will incorporate functional features into the map that display magnitude and location of earthquakes GeoJSON data in a pop up marker. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will be represented with larger diameters and darker colors. We will utilize mapping features to represent geographical points and tectonic fault lines which will be displayed in refrence to the geographic region it is located. 

# Below you will find earthquake data in relation to :

* The tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.
* Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
* Earthquake data displayed on Streets, Satellite, Dark view.
